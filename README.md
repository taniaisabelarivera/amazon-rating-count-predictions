## Context:
Amazon is one of the biggest hubs of online shopping of the modern day, and has not only shaped how people shop, but also how they sell. Boasting over 9.7 million registered vendors worldwide, many use amazon.com to make a living. Using Predictive Modeling, vendors can now use available data (such as the data provided in this Amazon Sales Dataset) to predict how many sales their product is estimated to get based on its features.

## What This Notebook Looks To Answer:
What features of a product will influence higher ratings or reviews for a product? Does the rating or price of a product determine how many sales (assuming rating_count is only made up of customers who bought the product) a product will receive?

## Limitations Of This Dataset:
The data in the Amazon Sales Dataset (linked below) was scraped from the official Amazon website. This Dataset does not include any actual sales data, which limit how accurately the predictive model can predict sales based on the features provided. All analysis and conclusions are made assuming all reviews were made by customers who bought the products listed. All price categories are also provided in Indian Rupee, which may affect the conclusion. Despite this, all efforts were made to convert data types and prices into something workable.
